Alice’s story is typical of many disadvantaged children,
who often feel lonely and vulnerable.

:Through no fault of her own, Alice feels different from the other children.
:Without the money for proper uniforms, shoes, school supplies and excursions –
:or even a bus to school – she feels she doesn’t fit in, and struggles to make friends.

She finds it hard to join in with the others in class and doesn’t have
:the support she needs to catch up. With every day that passes her confidence erodes,
:leaving her isolated, feeling lost and empty inside.

As her self-esteem plummets, so do her chances for a better future.
